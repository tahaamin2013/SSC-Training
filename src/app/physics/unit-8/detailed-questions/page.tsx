                            Magnetism is a physical phenomenon produced by the motion of electric charge, which results in attractive and repulsive forces between objects. It is a fundamental force in nature, characterized by magnetic fields that are produced by moving charges or magnetic materials. These fields exert forces on other magnetic materials or moving charges. Magnetism is closely related to electricity, and together they are described by the theory of electromagnetism.

                            The domain theory of magnetism explains that ferromagnetic materials are composed of small regions called domains. Within each domain, the magnetic moments of atoms are aligned in the same direction. When a ferromagnetic material is not magnetized, these domains are oriented randomly, causing the material to have no net magnetic field. When the material is magnetized, the domains align in a common direction, resulting in a strong net magnetic field. This theory helps explain why some materials can retain their magnetic properties even after the external magnetic field is removed.

                            Magnetic field strength, also known as magnetic intensity, is a measure of the force exerted by a magnetic field on a unit magnetic pole. It is represented by the symbol H and is measured in amperes per meter (A/m). The strength of a magnetic field depends on the source of the magnetic field and the distance from it.
                            <br />
                            Magnetic shielding refers to the process of reducing or blocking the effects of a magnetic field within a certain region. This can be achieved by using materials that absorb or redirect magnetic field lines. Common shielding materials include soft iron and mu-metal. Magnetic shielding is used in various applications to protect sensitive electronic equipment from external magnetic interference.

                            4. Explain the magnetic field of a bar magnet and that of a solenoid, also compare them.

                            A bar magnet generates a magnetic field that forms closed loops from its north pole to its south pole. The field lines are denser near the poles and more spread out away from the poles, indicating stronger magnetic fields near the poles.
                            <br />
                            A solenoid is a coil of wire that produces a magnetic field when an electric current passes through it. The magnetic field of a solenoid is similar to that of a bar magnet, with a well-defined north and south pole. However, the field lines inside a solenoid are parallel and uniform, which makes the magnetic field stronger and more concentrated inside the coil compared to the bar magnet.
                            <br />
                            **Comparison:** The bar magnet has a natural magnetic field with poles at the ends, while the solenoid&apos;s magnetic field is created by an electric current and can be controlled by adjusting the current and the number of coils. The solenoidâ€™s magnetic field is generally more uniform and stronger in comparison to a bar magnet.

                            Induced magnetism is the process by which a material becomes magnetized when exposed to an external magnetic field. The external field causes the magnetic domains within the material to align in the direction of the field, making the material itself act like a magnet.
                            <br />
                            Methods for inducing magnetism include:
                            <br />
                            - **Placing a material in a magnetic field:** This aligns the magnetic domains in the direction of the external field, temporarily magnetizing the material.
                            <br />
                            - **Contact with a magnet:** When a magnetic material is brought into contact with a permanent magnet, it can become magnetized.
                            <br />
                            - **Electromagnetic induction:** Passing an electric current through a coil wrapped around a material can induce magnetism in the material.
