                Pressure is particularly useful for dealing with liquids and gases, as it exerts pressure in every direction. That&apos;s why during swimming we feel pressure on all parts of our body. Similarly we live at the bottom of the earth&apos;s atmosphere, which pushes inward on our bodies just like the water in a swimming pool.

                &apos;The pressure that atmospheric particles exert on the surface of earth and all over the surface of objects on the earth is called atmospheric pressure&apos;. The pressure of the air at a given place varies slightly according to the weather and height from sea level. At sea level, the pressure of the atmosphere on average is 1.013 x 10⁵ Nm² (or 1.013 x 10⁵ Pa). This value lets us define a commonly used unit of pressure, the atmosphere (abbreviated atm), such that

            <p className="text-base">
                Another unit of pressure sometimes used (in meteorology and on weather maps) is the bar, which is defined as 1 bar = 1.000 x 10⁵ Pa.

                How a suction cup gets its sticking force? It is because of the atmospheric pressure. When we push the cup against a smooth wall, we actually force the air out of the cup, allowing atmospheric pressure to hold it to the wall. Another example of atmospheric pressure can be seen when we pump the air out of sealed can, atmospheric pressure produces an inward force that is unopposed, this results in the collapse of the can (figure 5.9).

                In 17th century Otto Von Guricke (German physicist) fitted two hollow bronze hemispheres together and removed the air from the resulting sphere with a pump. Two eight horse teams were unable to pull the halves apart, even though the hemispheres fell apart when the air was readmitted.

            <p className="text-base">
                A liquid barometer is a device that measures atmospheric pressure using the principles of hydrostatics and the behavior of liquids. The most common type of liquid barometer is the mercury barometer.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base">
                The liquid barometer works on the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium, which states that the pressure at any point in a fluid at rest is the same at all depths.

            <p className="text-base">
                In a mercury barometer, a tube filled with mercury is inverted into a container of mercury. The mercury in the tube seeks a level where the weight of the mercury column is balanced by atmospheric pressure on the surface of the mercury in the container. The height of the mercury column in the tube represents the atmospheric pressure as shown in the figure 5.10. At sea level, the atmosphere will push down mercury in the tub and make it rise up in a tube to a height of approximately 760 millimeters (mmHg) or 29.92 inches. 1 atm = 760 mmHg = 101.325 kPa The torr is another unit of pressure, equivalent to 1 mmHg.

            <p className="text-base">
                Changes in pressure cause the mercury level to rise or fall, indicating pressure variations associated with altitude and local weather conditions.

                Mercury barometers are precise, but they can be harmful to health because of the toxic nature of mercury. When safety is a priority, aneroid or digital barometers are commonly chosen as alternatives.

                Liquid barometers have various applications:

                <p className="text-base">
                    Liquid barometers (including mercury barometers), can estimate altitude. As atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude, the height of the mercury column decreases, allowing for altitude calculations. They are essential instruments in aviation for altitude measurements and setting aircraft altimeters.

                    They are used in meteorology to measure atmospheric pressure, which is associated with weather changes. A falling barometer may indicate an approaching storm, while a rising barometer suggests improvement in weather conditions.

            <p className="text-base">
                The atmospheric pressure decreases as we go up from the surface of earth. On mountains the atmospheric pressure is lower than at sea level, decreasing gradually to zero. The climbers at high altitudes encounter lower atmospheric pressure due to the thinner air. The thinner air causes breathing difficulties due to the lower level of oxygen. The graph in figure 5.11 shows that at Mount Everest (height of 8.8 km above sea level) the atmospheric pressure is only 33 kPa, and where Boing 747 flies the atmospheric pressure is around 23 kPa.

            <p className="text-base">
                Barometers that are kept in the same place at the same height above sea level show some variation in atmospheric pressure from day to day. These pressure variations are shown on weather maps (fig. 5.12). The lines in the map joining all those places with the same atmospheric pressure are called isobars. The unit for pressure used in weather maps is the millibar (mbar). 1 mbar = 100 Pa
            </p>
            <p className="text-base">
                Usually the range of atmospheric pressure varies from the very high pressure of 1040 mbar to as low as 950 mbar. Winds move from high pressure regions to low pressure regions. The strength of the wind is determined by the pressure difference. From the weather map, when the isobars are packed closely together, it indicates a high pressure difference.

            <p className="text-base">
                (A) DRINKING BY STRAW: The drinking through straw is possible by lowering the pressure in the mouth below atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 5.13 (a). The action of sucking increases the volume of lungs, thereby reducing the air pressure in the lungs and the mouth. The atmospheric pressure acting on the surface of the liquid will then be greater than the pressure in the mouth, thus forcing the liquid to rise up the straw into the mouth.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base">
                (B) DRAWING LIQUID BY SYRINGE: We can draw liquid up the syringe, as shown in Figure 5.13 (b), the piston of the syringe is drawn back upwards. This decreases the pressure within the cylinder. Atmospheric pressure acting on the surface of the liquid drives the liquid into the cylinder through the nozzle of the syringe.

            <p className="text-base">
                Why it is difficult to cook food at high altitudes? As altitude increases and atmospheric pressure decreases, the boiling point of water decreases. To compensate for the lower boiling point of water, the cooking time must be increased. Turning up the heat will not help cook food.
