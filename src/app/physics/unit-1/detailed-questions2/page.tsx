  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-6">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Q.No.4 Write a note on the Screw Gauge</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A screw gauge is the instrument used to measure small lengths accurately up to one-hundredth part of a millimeter. It is also called a micrometer screw gauge. Its accuracy is greater than that of a vernier caliper.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Construction</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          It consists of a U-shaped metal stud at one end. A hollow cylinder (or sleeve) has a millimeter scale over it along a line called the index line, parallel to its axis. The hollow circular scale acts as a nut. A thimble has a threaded spindle inside it.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Circular Scale</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The thimble has 100 divisions around one end. It is the circular scale of the screw gauge. As the thimble completes one rotation, 100 divisions pass the index line, and the thimble moves 1 mm along the main scale. Thus, each division of the circular scale crossing the index line moves the thimble through 1/100 mm or 0.01 mm on the main scale.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Pitch</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As the thimble completes one rotation, the spindle moves 1 mm along the index line. The distance between consecutive threads on the spindle is 1 mm; this distance is called the pitch of the screw gauge.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Least Count</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The least count of a screw gauge can be found as follows:
          <br />
          <code className="bg-gray-100 p-1 rounded">Least count = pitch of screw gauge / number of divisions on the circular scale</code>
          <br />
          <code className="bg-gray-100 p-1 rounded">= 1 mm / 100 = 0.01 mm = 0.001 cm</code>
          <br />
          The least count of the screw gauge is 0.01 mm or 0.001 cm.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Zero Error of Screw Gauge</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If we close the gap between the spindle and the stud of the screw gauge by rotating the ratchet in the clockwise direction, and if the zero of the circular scale coincides with the index line, then the zero error will be zero. If the zero of the circular scale does not coincide with the index line, then there is a zero error in the screw gauge.
        </p>
        <div className="pb-6">
  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Positive Zero Error</h3>
  <p className="mb-4">
    If the zero of the circular scale is behind (below) the index line, it will measure slightly more than the actual thickness, and this is called positive zero error.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    <strong>Zero Correction:</strong> In this case, multiply the number of divisions of the circular scale that have not crossed the index line by the least count of the screw gauge to find the zero error. This error will be subtracted from the observed measurement.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Negative Zero Error</h3>
  <p className="mb-4">
    If the zero of the circular scale has crossed (above) the index line, it will show slightly less than the actual thickness, and this is called negative zero error.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    <strong>Zero Correction:</strong> In this case, multiply the number of divisions of the circular scale that have crossed the index line by the least count of the screw gauge to find the zero error. This error will be added to the observed measurement.

    "An instrument used to measure the time interval or specific period of an event is known as a stop watch."
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Types of Stop Watch</h3>
  <p className="mb-4">There are two types of stop watches:</p>

  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
    <li>Mechanical stop watch</li>
    <li>Electronic stop watch (digital stop watch)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Mechanical Stop Watch</h4>
  <p className="mb-4">
    A mechanical stop watch can measure a time interval up to a minimum of 0.1 seconds.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    <strong>How to Use:</strong> A mechanical stop watch has a knob that is used to wind the spring that powers the watch. It can also be used as the start, stop, and reset button. The watch starts when the knob is pressed once. When pressed a second time, it stops the watch, while the third press brings the needle back to the zero position.
  </p>

  <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Electronic/Digital Stop Watch</h4>
  <p className="mb-4">
    A digital stop watch, commonly used in laboratories, can measure a time interval accurately up to 1/100 second or 0.01 seconds.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    <strong>How to Use:</strong> The digital stop watch starts to indicate the time elapsed when the start/stop button is pressed. As soon as the start/stop button is pressed again, it stops and indicates the time interval recorded between the start and stop of an event. A reset button restores its initial zero settings.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-4">
    The watch is named "stop watch" because it can be started or stopped at will as required when the duration of the time is to be measured.

    question:
      "What do you know about the Measuring Cylinder? How is the volume of liquids measured using this cylinder?",
    answer: `
      <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-6">
  <p className="mb-4">
    A measuring cylinder is a cylindrical tube that is used to measure the volume of liquid or powdered substances. It is also used to find the volume of an irregular-shaped solid insoluble in a liquid by the displacement method.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Construction</h3>
  <p className="mb-4">
    It is made of transparent plastic or glass, and it has a vertical scale in milliliters (ml) or cubic centimeters (cm³). Measuring cylinders have different capacities ranging from 100 ml to 2500 ml.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Measurement of Volume</h3>
  <p className="mb-4">
    When a liquid is put into it, the volume is noted on the scale in front of the meniscus of the liquid. The meniscus of most liquids curves downwards, while the meniscus of mercury curves upwards.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Precautions</h3>
  <p className="mb-4">
    To measure the volume of the liquid correctly, the following precautions should be kept in mind:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
    <li>The cylinder must be placed on a horizontal surface.</li>
    <li>The eye should be kept level with the bottom of the meniscus (curved surface). When the eye is above the liquid level, the meniscus appears higher on the scale. Similarly, when the eye is below the liquid level, the meniscus appears lower than the actual height of the liquid.</li>

    question:
      "Define and explain Significant figures. What are the main points to be kept in mind while determining the significant figures of a result?",
    answer: `
        <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-6">
  <p className="mb-4">
    In any measurement, the accurately known digits and the first doubtful digit in an expression are called significant figures. They reflect the precision of a measured value of a physical quantity.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Accuracy of Measurement</h3>
  <p className="mb-4">
    The value of a physical quantity is expressed by a number followed by some suitable unit. Every measurement is an attempt to find the true value. The accuracy in measuring a physical quantity depends upon various factors:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
    <li>The quality of the measuring instrument</li>
    <li>The skill of the observer</li>
    <li>The number of observations made</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Example</h3>
  <p className="mb-4">
    A student measures the length of a book as 18 cm using a measuring tape. The number of significant figures in this measurement is two. The left digit is the accurately known digit, while the digit 8 is a doubtful digit, which the student may not be sure about.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Another student measures the same book using a ruler and claims its length to be 18.4 cm. In this case, all three figures are significant. The two left digits 1 and 8 are accurately known, while the digit 4 is the doubtful digit.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    A third student records the length of the book as 18.425 cm using the same ruler. The number of significant figures is again three, consisting of the two accurately known digits 1 and 8, and the first doubtful digit 4. The digits 2 and 5 are not significant because the measurement is limited by the instrument.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    An improvement in the quality of measurement by using a better instrument increases the significant figures in the measured result. Significant figures include all the digits that are known accurately and the one estimated digit. More significant figures mean greater precision.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Rules for Determining Significant Figures</h3>
  <p className="mb-4">The following rules are helpful in identifying significant figures:</p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
    <li>Non-zero digits are always significant.</li>
    <li>Zeros in between two significant figures are also significant. For example, in <code className="bg-gray-100 p-1 rounded">1.406</code>, the number of significant figures is 4.</li>
    <li>In any observation, the zeros on the left side of the decimal point for the purpose of spacing the decimal point are not significant. For example, in <code className="bg-gray-100 p-1 rounded">0.0036</code>, the number of significant figures is 2.</li>
    <li>Final or ending zeros on the right side of decimal fractions are considered significant. For example, the number of significant figures in <code className="bg-gray-100 p-1 rounded">2.450</code> is four.</li>
    <li>In whole numbers that end in one or more zeros without a decimal point, these zeros may or may not be significant. In such cases, express the quantity using scientific notation.</li>
    <li>If numbers are recorded in scientific notation, then all the digits before the power of 10 are significant. For example, in <code className="bg-gray-100 p-1 rounded">1.40 x 10<sup>3</sup></code>, the number of significant figures is three.</li>
  </ul>

* Significant Figures
** Definition
*** Accurately known digits + first doubtful digit
*** Reflect precision of a measured value
** Accuracy of Measurement
*** Dependent on:
**** Quality of the measuring instrument
**** Skill of the observer
**** Number of observations
** Examples
*** Measurement of 18 cm
**** Significant Figures: 2 (18)
*** Measurement of 18.4 cm
**** Significant Figures: 3 (18.4)
*** Measurement of 18.425 cm
**** Significant Figures: 5 (18.42)
** Rules for Determining Significant Figures
*** Non-zero digits are always significant
**** Example: 1.406 (4 significant figures)
*** Zeros between significant figures are significant
**** Example: 1.406 (4 significant figures)
*** Leading zeros are not significant
**** Example: 0.0036 (2 significant figures)
*** Trailing zeros in decimal fractions are significant
**** Example: 2.450 (4 significant figures)
*** Trailing zeros in whole numbers without decimal points may or may not be significant
**** Use scientific notation to clarify
*** In scientific notation, all digits before the power of 10 are significant
**** Example: 1.40 x 10^3 (3 significant figures)

    question: "Write down the rules to round off the numbers.",
    answer: `
       <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-6">
  <p className="mb-4">
    The following rules are used to round off numbers:
  </p>
  <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 mb-4">
    <li>
      If the last digit is less than 5, then it is simply dropped. This decreases the number of significant digits in the figure.
      <br /> 
      <strong>Example:</strong> 1.943 is rounded to 1.94 (3 significant figures)
    </li>
    <li>
      If the last digit is greater than 5, then the digit on its left is increased by one. This also decreases the number of significant digits in the figure.
      <br /> 
      <strong>Example:</strong> 1.47 is rounded to 1.5 (two significant digits)
    </li>
    <li>
      If the last digit is 5, then it is rounded to get the nearest even number.
      <br />
      <strong>Example:</strong>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2">
        <li>1.35 is rounded to 1.4</li>
