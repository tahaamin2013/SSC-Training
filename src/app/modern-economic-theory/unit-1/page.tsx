* NATURE OF ECONOMICS: DEFINITIONS

** Arguments Against Defining Economics
*** Dr. J.N. Keynes: "strangled itself with definitions"
*** Richard Jones & Comte: Abolish definitions
*** Pareto, Myrdal, Hutchinson: Barren enterprise, waste of time
**** Pareto: "waste of time to investigate"
**** Myrdal: "economist need not be concerned"
**** Hutchinson: "does not appear to solve any useful problem"

** Arguments For Defining Economics
*** Robbins: Not a waste of time
*** Macfie: Lack of definition is harmful
*** Author's Opinion: Essential for students, discussion leads to understanding

** Conclusion
*** Need to examine existing definitions

* EARLY DEFINITIONS: SCIENCE OF WEALTH

** Definition (Early Economists)
*** Adam Smith: "Enquiry into the Nature and Causes of Wealth of Nations"
*** J.E. Cairnes: "deals with the phenomenon of wealth"
*** J.B. Say: "science which treats of wealth"
*** F.A. Walker: "body of knowledge which relates to wealth"

** Criticism of Wealth-Focused Definition
*** Emphasis on wealth caused repulsion (religious sentiment)
*** Carlyle: "pig science"
*** Ruskin: Negative view
*** S. Bailey: "man-degrading, sordid inquiry"
*** Kirzner: "unworthiness...from explicit preoccupation with...wealth"
*** Economics seen as teaching selfishness, "dismal science"

** Shift in Focus
*** Late 19th Century: Humanistic character recognized
*** Schaffle & Droz: Man's role higher than wealth
*** Wealth as a means to an end (human welfare)
*** Marshall: "Economics is...a study of wealth; and...a part of the study of man"
**** Economics as science of human welfare, not just wealth

** Robbins' Contribution
*** Freed Economics from accusations of sordidness
*** Economics concerned with *all* ends (noble or ignoble) if scarce resources are used
*** Economics embraces all conduct under influence of scarcity

** Fraser's Classification
*** Type A: Wealth and material welfare
*** Type B: Scarcity of means and multiplicity of ends
*** Transition from Type A to Type B (post-Robbins)

* MARSHALLIAN DEFINITION: SCIENCE OF MATERIAL WELFARE

** Definition (Traditional View)
*** Beveridge: "study of general methods by which men cooperate to meet their material needs"
*** Cannan: "explanation of general causes on which material welfare depends"
*** Pigou: "range...restricted to...measuring rod of money"
*** Marshall: "Political Economy...that part of individual and social action most closely connected with...material requisites of well-being"

** Key Points of Marshall's Definition
*** Wealth as a means to human welfare (not an end in itself)
*** Focus on "ordinary men and women" (not just "economic man")
*** Social science: studies people in society
*** Studies "material requisites of well-being" (materialistic aspect)

** Criticism of Marshallian View (Lionel Robbins)
*** (1) Material vs. Immaterial: Economics considers both, not just material welfare.
*** (2) Classificatory Definition:  Wrong to distinguish between material and non-material welfare.
*** (3) Restricted Scope: Examples: wages for ministerial services, non-material productivity.
*** (4) Materiality is not the key:  Services of doctors, lawyers are economic goods (scarce, valuable). "It is their relation to valuations."
*** (5) Welfare is vague: Ideas of welfare vary. Intoxicants are wealth but don't promote welfare. "Why talk of welfare at all?"
*** (6) Ethical Judgments: Assessing welfare requires ethical judgments, but economics should be neutral regarding ends.
*** (7) Scope of Economics: Marshall focuses on people in society, but others also face economic problems (scarce means, unlimited ends).

** Robbins' Main Argument
*** Marshall's definition focuses only on the material aspect, while economics deals with both material and non-material.  The *label* is wrong, even if the *contents* are partly correct.

* ROBBINS' DEFINITION: SCIENCE OF SCARCITY OR SCIENCE OF CHOICE

** Challenge to Traditional View
*** Robbins' book (1931): "Nature and Significance of Economic Science"
*** Criticized traditional definitions as "classificatory" and "unscientific"
*** Rejected "material" limitation and "welfare" conception

** Robbins' Definition
*** "Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses."
*** Analytical (not classificatory): Focus on *aspect* of behavior (resource utilization)

** Three Fundamental Propositions
*** (a) Unlimited Ends (Wants)
**** Human wants are unlimited and recurring.
**** Multiplicity of wants drives economic activity.
**** Scarcity necessitates choice between wants.
**** Economics as a "science of choice."

*** (b) Scarce Means
**** Means (resources) are limited.
**** Scarcity is relative (demand vs. supply), not absolute.
**** Scarcity is the basis of economic problems.

*** (c) Alternative Uses
**** Scarce means have multiple uses.
**** Different uses have varying importance.
**** Choice is required in allocating resources to different uses.

** Economic Activity (Robbins)
*** Man's utilization of scarce means (with alternative uses) for satisfying multiple ends.

** Means and Ends
*** Means: Time, money, property (all limited)
*** Ends: Unlimited, requiring choice.

** Other Definitions
*** Wicksteed (State perspective): "study of principles on which resources should be regulated...to secure communal ends without waste."
*** Stigler: "study of principles governing the allocation of scarce means...to maximise the attainment of the ends."

** Summary
*** Economics is the study of allocating scarce means (with alternative uses) among competing ends for maximum results.

* SUPERIORITY OF ROBBINS' DEFINITION

** Robbins' Foundation
*** Demolished old structure (material welfare)
*** Built on two foundation stones: Unlimited wants & Scarcity of means

** Claims of Superiority
*** (a) More Scientific
**** Not based on artificial classifications (material/non-material)
**** Independent of classification

*** (b) Wider Content
**** Encompasses all human wants (material & non-material)
**** Applies to all types of persons (in society or not)

*** (c) Widened Scope
**** Marshall restricted it to wealth activities related to material welfare.
**** Robbins expanded it beyond material welfare.

*** (d) Elevated to Science
**** Earlier economists: both science and art (imperfect art).
**** Robbins: pure science.

*** (e) Positive Science
**** Earlier economists: also normative (value judgments).
**** Robbins: positive only (enunciates principles, no moralizing).

*** (f) Transcends Boundaries
**** Applicable to all times and places (Wicksteed: "like laws of life").
**** Not limited to wealth production.

*** (g) Freed from Criticism
**** No longer "sordid" or "dismal" (not responsible for selecting ends).
**** Concerned wherever ends are many and means are scarce.

** Conclusion
*** Robbins' definition is superior to both early (science of wealth) and Marshall's (science of material welfare) definitions.

* CRITICISM OF ROBBINS' DEFINITION

** General Criticisms
*** Marshallian Spirit: Durbin, Fraser, Wootton, Beveridge defend Marshall.
*** Wootton: Difficult to remove all normative significance.
*** Robbins' Economics: Colorless, impersonal, neutral.
*** Thomas: Economist's function: explain, explore, *advocate*, *condemn*.

** Specific Criticisms
*** (a) Overly Broad Scope
**** Abandoning search for specific ends widens scope too much.
**** Includes non-economic phenomena.
*** (b) Detachment from Reality
**** Lack of concern for ends makes theory purely formal.
**** Souter: "juggler with static verbal logic," "profane sunderer of 'form' and 'substance'."
*** (c) Ends-Means Formulation
**** Not in line with human action (excludes purpose).
**** Ends and means are often interchangeable.
**** Knight: Economics should discuss alternative ends, not just means.

*** (d) Reduced to Valuation Theory
**** Neglects other aspects of economics.
**** Fraser: "Economics is more than a value theory."
**** Doesn't cover Keynesian economics (national income, employment).
**** Limited to "allocative role."

*** (e) Individual Choice Focus
**** Cairncross: Studies choices with *social* repercussions.
**** Ignores purely individual choices.

*** (f) Ignores Economic Growth
**** Robbins focuses on resource allocation (given resources).
**** Doesn't explain economic growth/development.

*** (g) Doesn't Explain Unemployment
**** Studies scarcity, but unemployment is about abundance of labor.

*** (h) Lacks Human Touch
**** Ely: Economics needs "human sympathy, imagination, and commonsense."

*** (i) Too Abstract and Complex
**** Difficult and unfruitful.
**** Detracts from utility for the common man.
**** Should be more concrete and realistic.

* MODERN DEFINITION OF ECONOMICS

** Shift from Robbins' View
*** Economics is more than just value theory or resource allocation.

** Keynesian Revolution
*** J.M. Keynes: Economics studies how income and employment levels are determined.
*** Focus on administration of scarce resources *and* determinants of income and employment.
*** Studies causes of economic fluctuations and how to promote stability.

** Other Modern Definitions
*** Benham: "study of factors affecting size, distribution, and stability of national income."

** Inclusion of Growth and Stability
*** Economic growth theory: Important place in modern economics (especially for developing countries).
*** Studies how national income grows over time.
*** Developing economies (e.g., India): Need both economic stability *and* growth.
*** A good definition must cover both growth and stability.

* CONCLUSION REGARDING DEFINITION

** Difficulty of Defining Economics
*** No short definition suffices for a growing science.
*** Defining as "science of wealth": Too narrow/uncharitable.
*** Defining as "study of mankind...": Too broad.
*** Defining as "study of material welfare": Too narrow.
*** Defining as "science of scarcity/choice/valuation": Too wide.
*** Defining as "part of social welfare...money": Too narrow.

** Viner's View
*** "Economics is what economists do."
*** Economists study resource allocation/utilization, national income (size, distribution, stability), and economic growth.

** Comprehensive Definitions
*** "A social science concerned with the proper uses and allocation of resources for the achievement and maintenance of growth with stability."
*** "A social science concerned chiefly with the way society chooses to employ its limited resources...to produce goods and services for present and future consumption."
*** These definitions describe and analyze the nature and behavior of the economy.

** Henry Smith's Definition
*** "Study of how in a civilized society one obtains the share...of what other people have produced and of how the total product...changes and is determined."
*** This definition covers:
**** Distribution of wealth.
**** Determination of level and changes in total product (implies growth theory).
