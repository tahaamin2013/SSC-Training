            <p className="mb-4">
                Input devices are the tools we use to send information to our computers. They help us type words, move things on the screen, and even talk to our computers. Let&apos;s look at some common input devices:
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Keyboard</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                The keyboard is one of the most basic input devices. It has buttons with letters, numbers, and special signs. When you press a key, the computer knows what letter or number you want. Keyboards help us type words, write emails, and enter data.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Mouse</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                A mouse lets you move a pointer on your computer screen. It has buttons you can click to select things or open programs. Some mice have a scroll wheel to help you move up and down pages easily.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Joystick</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Joysticks are often used for playing games. They have a stick you can move in different directions. This helps control things in games, like moving a character or flying a plane.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Scanner</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Scanners can take a picture of a paper document and turn it into a digital file. This is useful for saving old photos or important papers on your computer.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Trackball</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                A trackball is like an upside-down mouse. Instead of moving the whole device, you roll a ball with your fingers. This can be easier for some people to use than a regular mouse.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Light Pen</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                A light pen is a special pen you can use to draw directly on a computer screen. It&apos;s often used by artists or designers to create digital artwork.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Voice Microphone</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                With a microphone, you can talk to your computer. Some programs can turn your speech into written words. You can also use it to make voice calls or record sounds.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Digital Video Camera</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                A digital video camera can record moving pictures and send them to your computer. This is great for making videos or having video chats with friends.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Disk Drive</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                A disk drive reads information from disks or USB drives. It&apos;s a way to add files to your computer or save files from your computer onto a disk.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
                These input devices help us interact with our computers in different ways. Some are better for typing, others for drawing or playing games. In the next chapter, we&apos;ll learn about output devices and how they show us information from the computer.
