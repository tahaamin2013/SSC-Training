            <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Chapter 5: The Future of Input and Output Devices</h1>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Technology is always changing and getting better. Let&apos;s look at some exciting new ideas for future input and output devices:
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR):</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Input:</strong> Special gloves or hand trackers might let us &quot;touch&quot; virtual objects.</li>
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> VR headsets could make us feel like we&apos;re in a different world. AR glasses might add computer images to what we see in the real world.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Brain-Computer Interfaces:</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Input:</strong> We might be able to control computers just by thinking! Special devices could read our brain signals.</li>
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> Computers might send information directly to our brains, helping people with certain disabilities to see or hear.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Holographic Displays:</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> Instead of flat screens, we might see 3D images floating in the air. This could make video calls feel like the person is really there.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Flexible and Rollable Screens:</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> Imagine a big screen you can roll up like paper. You could carry a large display in your pocket!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Advanced Voice Control:</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Input:</strong> Talking to our devices might become more natural. They might understand context and tone better, almost like talking to a person.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Gesture Control:</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Input:</strong> Cameras might watch our hand movements, letting us control devices without touching them. This could be great for kitchens or workshops where our hands are often dirty.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Haptic Feedback:</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> Devices might let us &quot;feel&quot; virtual objects. A phone could feel bumpy when we touch a picture of a rough surface.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Smart Contact Lenses:</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> Tiny displays in contact lenses could show us information right in our eyes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3D Printers:</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> Home 3D printers might become common, letting us make solid objects from computer designs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Smell and Taste Outputs:</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> Devices might create smells or even tastes to make virtual experiences more real.</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mb-4">
                These new technologies could change how we use computers in big ways. They might make computers easier to use and more helpful in our daily lives. Some could help people with disabilities do things they couldn&apos;t before.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
                But new technology can also bring new problems. We&apos;ll need to think about things like:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> How do we keep our thoughts private if computers can read our brains?</li>
                <li><strong>Health:</strong> Is it okay to wear AR glasses all day? How might it affect our eyes?</li>
                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Will everyone be able to afford these new devices?</li>
                <li><strong>Learning:</strong> How will we learn to use these new technologies?</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mb-4">
                As we see new input and output devices, it&apos;s good to be excited but also to think carefully about how they might change our lives.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
                Conclusion: We&apos;ve learned about many types of input and output devices in this book. From simple keyboards to future brain interfaces, these tools help us work with computers. As technology grows, the ways we interact with computers will keep changing. By understanding these devices, we can choose the best tools for our needs and be ready for new technologies as they come.
            </p>

            <p>
                Remember, the goal of all these devices is to make computers more helpful and easier to use. The best device is the one that works well for you and helps you do what you need to do.
