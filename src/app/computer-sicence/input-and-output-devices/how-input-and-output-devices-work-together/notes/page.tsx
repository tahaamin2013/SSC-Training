            <p className="mb-4">
                Computers are most useful when input and output devices work as a team. Let&aposs look at some ways they work together:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Typing and Seeing:</strong> When you type on a keyboard (input), the letters show up on your monitor (output). This lets you see what you&aposre writing as you type.</li>
                <li><strong>Drawing and Printing:</strong> You might use a light pen or mouse (input) to draw a picture on your screen. Then you can use a printer (output) to make a paper copy of your drawing.</li>
                <li><strong>Scanning and Editing:</strong> A scanner (input) can put a photo into your computer. You can then see it on your monitor (output) and change it using your mouse and keyboard (input).</li>
                <li><strong>Voice and Text:</strong> You can speak into a microphone (input), and some programs can turn your words into text on the screen (output).</li>
                <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> When you play a computer game, you might use a joystick or keyboard (input) to control what happens. The game&aposs sounds come from speakers, and the pictures show on your monitor (both output).</li>
                <li><strong>Video Chats:</strong> In a video chat, your camera and microphone (input) send your video and voice to the computer. At the same time, your monitor and speakers (output) let you see and hear the other person.</li>
                <li><strong>Saving Work:</strong> After you create something on your computer, you can save it to a disk drive (output). Later, you can use the same disk drive (input) to put the file back on your computer.</li>
                <li><strong>Printing from a File:</strong> You can open a file from your disk drive (input), see it on your monitor (output), and then send it to a printer (output) to make a paper copy.</li>
                <li><strong>Creating Music:</strong> You might play music on a digital piano keyboard (input). The computer can show the notes on the monitor (output) and play the sounds through speakers (output).</li>
                <li><strong>Learning Programs:</strong> In a learning program, you might answer questions using your keyboard or mouse (input). The program can then show your score on the monitor (output) or print a report (output).</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mb-4">
                These examples show how input and output devices need each other. Input devices let us tell the computer what to do. Output devices let the computer show us the results. Together, they make computers easy and fun to use.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
                By working together, input and output devices help us do many tasks:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Write and edit documents</li>
                <li>Make and change pictures</li>
                <li>Play games</li>
                <li>Talk to people far away</li>
                <li>Learn new things</li>
                <li>Create music</li>
                <li>Save our work</li>
                <li>And much more!</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mb-4">
                Understanding how these devices work together can help you use your computer better. In the next chapter, we&aposll talk about how to choose the right input and output devices for different tasks.
