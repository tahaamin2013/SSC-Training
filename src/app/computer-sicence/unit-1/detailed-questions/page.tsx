                                    <li><strong>Layer 3 - Network:</strong> Manages logical addressing and routing of data packets between different networks.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Layer 4 - Transport:</strong> Ensures end-to-end communication and data integrity, providing error recovery and flow control.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Layer 5 - Session:</strong> Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Layer 6 - Presentation:</strong> Translates data between the application layer and the network, including data encryption and compression.</li>
