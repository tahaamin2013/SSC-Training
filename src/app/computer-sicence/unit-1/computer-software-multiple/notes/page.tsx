                <p className="mb-4">
                    Computer software, often referred to simply as &quot;software,&quot; is a collection of programs, data, and instructions that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks or functions. It is an important component of any computer system, enabling it to process data, run applications, and interact with users. Software is typically categorized into two main types: system software and application software.
