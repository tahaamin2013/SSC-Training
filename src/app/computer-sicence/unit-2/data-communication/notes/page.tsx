                            Data Communication refers to the process of exchanging data or information between two or more devices or systems through a transmission medium such as cables, optical fibers, or wireless mediums. This communication can involve the transfer of various types of data, including text, numbers, images, audio, and video. It is a fundamental component of modern information technology and telecommunications.

                        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Network Communication Components</h2>
                        <p>Network communication consists of five basic components:</p>
                        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                            <li><strong>Sender:</strong> Also known as the transmitter, it is a computer or device that sends the message (data or information) from the source to the destination in a communication network. It may be a computer, workstation, cell phone, or camera.</li>
                            <li><strong>Message:</strong> The data or information to be transmitted, which can be in the form of text, audio, video, or any combination of these.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medium:</strong> The path through which the message travels from source to destination. It can be wired (e.g., telephone cable, coaxial cable, fiber optics) or wireless (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, microwave, radio wave, satellite).</li>
                            <li><strong>Receiver:</strong> The device that receives the transmitted message. It can be a computer, workstation, telephone handset, or television set.</li>
                            <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> A set of rules that governs data communications. It represents an agreement between the communicating devices, ensuring they can communicate effectively.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Modes of Network Communication</h2>
                        <p>Modes of network communication refer to the methods or ways information is transmitted from one place to another. The following are different modes of data communication:</p>
                        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                            <li><strong>Simplex Mode:</strong> Allows communication in only one direction. The receiver cannot send data back to the sender. Examples include electronic notice boards, radio, and television broadcasting.</li>
                            <li><strong>Half-Duplex Mode:</strong> Allows communication in both directions, but not at the same time. The sender and receiver take turns sending and receiving data. An example is a walkie-talkie, where each party must indicate when they have finished speaking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Full-Duplex Mode:</strong> Allows communication in both directions simultaneously. Both sender and receiver can send and receive data at the same time. Examples include telephone networks, where both parties can talk and listen simultaneously.</li>
                            <li><strong>Asynchronous Transmission:</strong> Involves variable time intervals between two characters. It uses start and stop bits for synchronization. This type is ideal for slow-speed communication where gaps may occur, such as keyboard data transmission.</li>
                            <li><strong>Synchronous Transmission:</strong> Has fixed time intervals between characters. The sender and receiver are synchronized, sending data as a continuous stream without start and stop bits. It is faster than asynchronous transmission due to fewer control bits and is used in network communication links.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Communication Devices</h2>
                        <p>A Communication Device is used in telecommunication systems to transmit data from one location to another. Commonly used devices include:</p>
                        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                            <li><strong>Hub:</strong> A connectivity device used in LAN. It connects multiple LAN devices on one network, making them act as a single network. It is non-intelligent and sends output to all devices on the network.</li>
                            <li><strong>Switch:</strong> Performs the same job as a hub but is more intelligent. It forwards data packets only to the intended recipient node, using information about the data packet.</li>
                            <li><strong>Router:</strong> Connects two or more networks, forwarding data packets by selecting the best pathway based on network traffic. It connects local networks to the internet and routes data efficiently.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gateway:</strong> Connects different networks that use different protocols. It changes the format of data packets without altering the message content to make them conform to the application program of the remote computer.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Network Architecture</h2>
