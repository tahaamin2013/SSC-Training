        A SUMMARY OF ISLAMIC BELIEFS
      </h1>
      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
        <li>
          <p>
            Allah is One indeed. He has absolutely no partner. He alone is
            worthy of being worshipped. He is all Independent and depends on
            none. All the worlds and creatures are subservient to Him.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We believe in all Apostles and Prophets whom Allah Almighty sent for
            the guidance of humanity. It is obligatory upon every believer to
            respect and revere all Apostles and consider them as Allahs1 â€˜loved
            ones&apos;. Our kind lord and master Hazrat Mohammed (may the choicest
            blessings & peace of Allah be upon him) is the leader and highest of
            all the Apostles and Prophets.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Allah, the Almighty has revealed books to some Apostles, which are
            called &quot;Kalaam Allah&quot; (speech of Allah). To have faith and belief in
            all the revealed books and in their contents is essential. Of all
            the revealed books, the Glorious Qur&apos;an which was gifted to our
            Beloved Prophet (Hazrat) Mohammed is the best and Allah Almighty
            Himself has taken up the responsibility of its protection.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Angels are the creatures of Allah, whom he has created from light.
            They are neither male nor female. They are innocent and obedient
            servants of Allah. They only do or perform what Allah commands them.
            They subsist on the worship and remembrance of Allah.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Genies have been created of fire. They live and die like human
            beings. There are believers, disbelievers, the good and the bad in
            them. Disbelieving and mischievous genies are called devils.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            One day everything (angels, mountains, animals, the earth, the sky)
            will perish like human beings. There will remain nothing in
            existence but Allah alone. Then all things will be re-created and
            the dead ones will be resurrected from their graves. All will be
            made to gather in a particular field that is called &quot;Mahshar&quot;. The
            Balance will be installed and deeds of each one will be weighed in
            it. Everyone will get the punishment of his/her misdeeds & sins and
            the reward of their own virtuous acts. Believers will be admitted
            into paradise while infidels (kaafir) and disbelievers will be cast
            into Hell.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Hell has a bridge over it that leads to heaven. It is called &quot;Pool
            Siraat&quot; (the path). It is thinner than a hair and sharper than a
            sword. All people will have to cross this &quot;Siraat&quot;. It is the one
            and only one pathway to reach heaven.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Whatever had to happen in the world and whatever one had to do -
            Allah Almighty wrote all of that with His eternally infinite
            knowledge. And whatever has been decreed will certainly happen
            without the slightest change. This is called &quot;Taqdeer&quot;
            (predestination).
