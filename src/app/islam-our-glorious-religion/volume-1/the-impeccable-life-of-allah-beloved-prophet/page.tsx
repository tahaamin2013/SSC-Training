            A. We belong to the community (Ummah) of Allah&apos;s Beloved Prophet
            Hazrat Mohammed Mustafa (may Allah&apos;s choicest blessings & peace be
            upon him).

            Q 2: Briefly mention about the childhood of the Holy Prophet
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. Our kind lord and master Hazrat Mohammed (may Allah&apos;s choicest
            blessings & peace be upon him) was born in Makkah city of Arabia.
            His father Hazrat Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) had
            passed away before his birth. His mother Hazrat Beebee Aminah (may
            Allah be pleased with her) also died when the Prophet was just six
            years old. Thus, the responsibility of his upbringing rested upon
            his paternal grandfather Hazrat Abdul Muttalib (may Allah be pleased
            with him). But he also expired when the Prophet attained the age of
            8 years, 2 months, and 10 days. Hazrat Haleema nursed and breastfed
            the Holy Prophet during his infancy.

            Q 3: At what age did Allah Almighty make him Prophet?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. The Holy Prophet Hazrat Mohammed Mustafa (may Allah&apos;s choicest
            blessings & peace be upon him) formally received Prophethood and the
            first revelation at the age of 40 years, but in fact, he was the
            &quot;first&quot; of all the Apostles and Prophets as he himself said that
            &quot;first of all Allah Almighty created my Noor (light).&quot;

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">
            Q 4: How did the Holy Prophet preach and promote Islam?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. At first, the Holy Prophet secretly preached Islam only to his
            close relatives and acquaintances because ignorance and barbarism
            reigned supreme in Arabia. The concept of One God as the Creator,
            Sustainer, and Nourisher was alien to their nature and soil. The
            first few Muslims worshipped Allah secretly. Gradually, the number
            of male and female converts swelled, and then Allah Almighty
            commanded the Holy Prophet to preach Islam openly. He did so, and
            Islam rapidly spread in Makkah and adjoining areas.

            Q 5: Who was the first to embrace Islam?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. Hazrat Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) was the first
            among men to embrace Islam, Hazrat Khudaija-tul-Kubra (may Allah be
            pleased with her) was first among women, Hazrat &apos;Alee (may Allah be
            pleased with him) was the first among young boys, and among slaves,
            Hazrat Zaid bin Harisah (may Allah be pleased with him) was the
            first to embrace Islam.
          </p>

            Q 6: Where did the Holy Prophet live throughout his life?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. The Holy Prophet preached Islam for 14 years in Makkah. Later, he
            migrated to Madinah, where he spent the rest of his life. His holy
            shrine is in Madinah Munawwara, visited by millions. He (apparently)
            passed away at the age of 63, but he is alive in his hallowed grave.

        {/* Question 7 */}
        <div>
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">
            Q 7: What special favor was bestowed to the Holy Prophet in Makkah?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. During the fifth year of Prophethood, the Holy Prophet was
            blessed with &quot;Me&apos;raaj&quot; (ascension to the heavens). He was taken on
            the &quot;Buraaq&quot; by Hazrat Jibreel from Makkah to Masjid Al-Aqsa and
            then to the skies. He saw Hell, Paradise, and Allah&apos;s Jamaal
            (splendidly sublime sight). On this occasion, Salaat (prayer) five
            times a day was made obligatory on believers.
          </p>

        {/* Question 8 */}
        <div>
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">
            Q 8: Is there any successor to the Prophethood of Hazrat Mohammed
            Mustafa (may Allah&apos;s choicest blessings & peace be upon him)?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. No, absolutely not. Hazrat Mohammed Mustafa (may Allah&apos;s choicest
            blessings & peace be upon him) is &quot;Khaataman Nabiyyeen&quot; (the Last
            Prophet). Believing in another Prophet after him makes one an
            infidel.

            Q 9: What rank does the Holy Prophet hold among the Prophets?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. Hazrat Mohammed Mustafa (may Allah&apos;s choicest blessings & peace
            be upon him) is the highest and leader of all Prophets. He is a
            perfect combination of all blessed traits, perfections, and miracles
            found individually in other Prophets.

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">
            Q 10: What about the belief of those who describe the Holy Prophet
            as a mere human being?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. Considering the Holy Prophet a mere human being or denigrating
            him in any way is apostasy and disbelief. Past nations were
            misguided due to such beliefs.
          </p>

            Q 11: What does it mean to believe in the Holy Prophet?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. Belief in Hazrat Mohammed Mustafa (may Allah&apos;s choicest blessings
            & peace be upon him) means unwavering faith in his Prophethood,
            loving him more than anyone else, and following his teachings for
            salvation.
