            Q 1: What is the Holy Qur&apos;an?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. The Glorious Qur&apos;an is the word of Allah (Kalaam Allah) which
            Allah has gifted to His Beloved Prophet Hazrat Mohammed (may Allah&apos;s
            choicest blessings & peace be upon him). To believe in what it
            contains is a part and parcel of our faith.

            Q 2: How do you know that the Holy Qur&apos;an is the Speech of Allah?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. The Holy Qur&apos;an is itself a convincing proof of it being the
            Speech of Allah. It declares and challenges infidels and
            disbelievers that &quot;if you are in some doubt about what we have sent
            to Our chosen bondman, then bring one chapter like it&quot;. All the
            enemies of Islam - particularly the eloquent poets of Arabia - put
            their heads together and strove hard to produce something like it
            but they failed miserably; they could not bring forth a single
            chapter, not even a single verse like it. Thus, the Holy Qur&apos;an is
            an open and everlasting miracle and a challenge to infidels and
            disbelievers till the end of time.

            Q 3: What is the distinction of the Qur&apos;an?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. The ever-living miracle of the Glorious Qur&apos;an is that the
            believers & even their children can commit the entire Qur&apos;an to
            their memory. Contrary to this, other revealed books could not be
            memorized by the followers of the books except the Prophets to whom
            the said books were revealed.

          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. The Holy Qur&apos;an was sent down in 23 years. Its verses were sent
            down either singly or in batches as the need arose.

            A. Our kind master Hazrat Mohammed Mustafa (may Allah&apos;s choicest
            blessings & peace be upon him) said, “He who recites a letter of the
            Qur&apos;an gets one goodness which is equal to ten good deeds” and
            stressed &quot;I do not say that &quot;Alif-Laaam-Meeem&quot; is one letter but
            ‘Alif&apos; is a letter, ‘Laam&apos; is another letter and ‘Meem&apos; is another
            letter.&quot;

          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. The Holy Prophet has said &quot;the chest (of a believer) which has
            nothing of the Qur&apos;an in it is like a deserted house&quot;.

            Q 7: What are the basic rules of reciting the Holy Qur&apos;an?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A. The believer should in the state of ablution (Wudu), and sit at a
            clean place preferably in mosque facing the Qibla (Holy Ka&apos;bah)
            placing the Holy Qur&apos;an before himself, on a raised surface. He
            should begin reciting the Glorious Qur&apos;an preceded by &quot;A&apos;oozu
            bil-Laahi Minash Shaietaa-nir Rajeem&quot; (I seek refuge with Allah from
            the Devil, the accursed) and &quot;Bismil-Laahir Rahmaa-nir Raheem&quot;
            (Allah, beginning with the name of, the Most Affectionate, the Most
            Merciful) with sincerity and humility. Show no haste but recite
            carefully and with calmness. Mind it! The mouth should be free from
            every kind of smell like onion, garlic etc and other hasty comments
            or invalid talks...
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            It is sinful to touch the Holy Qur&apos;an without ablution. Listeners
            should be attentive and respectful to the recitation.

          <p className="mt-2">
            A. A copy of the Holy Qur&apos;an which is worn out and is no more
            legible, should be buried, wrapped up in a piece of clean cloth, at
            such a place that is not trodden by human beings and animals. It is
            better to bury it in a grave-like ditch so as to save it from the
            earth.

            A. Yes, the copies of the Holy Qur&apos;an with correct text - without
            the slightest difference - are available everywhere. It is safe from
            being changed or corrupted as Allah Almighty is Himself its
