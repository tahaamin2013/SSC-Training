              The study of motion of an object without discussing the cause of
              motion is called kinematics.

            <AccordionTrigger>Q4. How would you define rest?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              If a body does not change its position with respect to
              surroundings, then it is said to be in a state of rest.
              Surroundings are the places in its neighborhood where various
              objects are present.

              If a body continuously changes its position with respect to

              Q6. How can we say that rest and motion are relative states?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              The state of rest or motion of a body is relative. For example, a
              passenger sitting in a moving bus is at rest because they are not
              changing their position with respect to other passengers in the
              bus. But to an observer outside the bus, the passengers and
              objects are in motion because they are changing their positions.

            <AccordionContent>
              The spinning motion of a body around its axis is called rotatory
              motion.
              <br />
              <strong>Examples:</strong>
              <br />
              - Motion of Earth around its geographic axis
              <br />
              - Motion of a wheel and steering wheel around its axis
              <br />
              - Motion of a ceiling electric fan
              <br />- The axis of rotation is a line around which a body
              rotates.

              <strong>Circular Motion:</strong> The point about which a body
              moves around is outside the body.
              <br />
              <strong>Rotatory Motion:</strong> The line around which a body
              moves about passes through the body itself.

            <AccordionTrigger>Q9. Define Vibratory motion.</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              When a body moves to and fro about its mean position, it is called
              vibratory motion. The motion of the body repeats from one extreme
              position to the other.
              <br />

            <AccordionTrigger>
              Q10. What do you know about scalar and vector quantities?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              A physical quantity that can be completely described by its
              magnitude only is called a scalar. The magnitude of a quantity
              means its numerical value with an appropriate unit.
              <br />
              <strong>Examples of Scalars:</strong> Mass, length, time, speed,
              volume, area, energy, etc.
              <br />
              <strong>Vector:</strong> A physical quantity that can be
              completely described by its magnitude along with its direction.
              <br />
              <strong>Examples of Vectors:</strong> Velocity, force,
              displacement, momentum, torque, etc.

            <AccordionTrigger>
              Q11. How are vector quantities important to us in our daily life?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              It would be meaningless to describe vectors without direction. For
              example, the distance of a place from a reference point is
              insufficient to locate that place. The direction of that place
              from the reference point is also necessary to locate it.

            <AccordionTrigger>
              Q12. What do you know about Vector Representation?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              <strong>Symbolic Representation:</strong> To represent vectors, we
              generally use bold letters like F, a, d, or a bar/arrow over their
              symbols.
              <br />
              <strong>Graphical Representation:</strong> Graphically, a vector
              can be represented by a segment with an arrowhead. The length of
              the line gives the magnitude of the vector, and the direction of
              the line gives the direction of the vector.

            <AccordionTrigger>Q13. What is Position?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              The term position describes the location of a place or a point
              with respect to some reference point. This reference point is
              called the origin.
              <br />
              <strong>Example:</strong> If you want to describe the position of
              your school from your home, the position will be represented by a
              straight line from your home (H) to the school (S).

              as distance between those points.

            <AccordionContent>
              The average speed of a body is the total distance covered divided
              by the total time taken.
              <br />
              <strong>Formula:</strong> Average speed = Total distance / Total

              <strong>Example:</strong> A car moving in a straight line with
              constant speed.

            <AccordionTrigger>Q21. What is variable velocity?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              If a body covers unequal displacements in equal intervals of time,
              or both change with time, then the body is said to be moving with
              variable velocity.
              <br />
              <strong>Example:</strong> A car moving on a curved path with
              uniform speed.

            <AccordionContent>
              The rate of change of velocity of a body with respect to time is
              called acceleration. It is represented by &quot;a.&quot;
              <br />
              <strong>Mathematical Form:</strong> Acceleration = Change in
              velocity / Time taken.
              <br />
              <strong>Quantity:</strong> It is a vector quantity.
              <br />
              <strong>Unit:</strong> SI unit of acceleration is meter per second
              squared (m/sÂ²).

              Q23. What do you know about uniform acceleration?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              If the velocity of a body increases or decreases by equal amounts
              in equal intervals of time, then the body is said to have uniform
              acceleration.
              <br />
              <strong>Example:</strong> Motion of a ball rolling down an
              inclined plane.
