        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The progress in science and technology has propelled society from a time when human strength
          was the primary source of energy, to a time where various forms of energy are harnessed.
          However, in every conversion of energy, there is always a loss of useful energy. It is evident that
          society cannot persistently consume increasing amounts of energy without taking into account
          the needs of future generations. The forthcoming challenge lies in the development of energy sources and processes that are sustainable. A sustainable resource is one that does not diminish over time and does not harm the delicate biosphere of the Earth, while still meeting the energy requirements of society On this classification the energy resources are divided into two groups renewable and nonrenewable
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Non-renewable energy resource is an energy resource that is limited and cannot be replaced naturally in short time. Most of the energy we use comes from non-renewable energy resources, for example fossil fuels like coal, natural gas and petroleum.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Renewable energy resource is an energy resource that is replaced rapidly by a natural process. Renewable energy resources capture their energy from an on-going natural processes, such as sunshine, wind, flowing water and biological processes. They are part of the planet&apos;s physical structure, which means they are constantly being renewed by natural means and cannot simply run out (technology not fuel). Apart from this advantage many renewable energy systems are better for the environment, compared to non-renewable energy sources.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-10 mb-4">Energy Conversion</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Energy conversion involves transforming available energy resources into a useful form. These resources provide the raw materials or sources used to generate energy for various purposes. including electricity generation, transportation, heating, and industrial processes. Nowadays, many energy converters focus on converting energy into electrical form. This process is facilitated by various devices and systems known as energy converters. Achieving a sustainable and reliable energy supply requires us to increase the use of renewable energy sources, enhance energy efficiency, and create new technologies to minimize environmental impacts.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          It is important to strike a balance between energy requirements and environmental and social concerns.
          The impact on the environment caused by the electricity system is influenced by different factors such as the generation and distribution methods used. In general, the environmental effects can include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li>Emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants, especially when a fuel is burned.</li>
          <li>Use of water resources to produce steam, provide cooling, and serve other functions.</li>
