                                A body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line provided no net force acts on it.

                            <p>
                                Newton&apos;s first law of motion applies to bodies at rest or moving with uniform speed in a straight line. A body at rest remains at rest unless acted upon by a net force. For example, a book lying on a table remains at rest as long as no net force acts on it.

                                Similarly, a moving object does not stop moving by itself. For instance, a ball rolled on a rough surface stops earlier than one rolled on a smooth surface due to greater friction on the rough surface. If there were no force opposing the motion, the body would never stop.

                                Since Newton&apos;s first law deals with the inertial property of matter, it is also known as the law of inertia. For example, passengers in a bus tend to fall forward when the driver suddenly applies the brakes because the upper parts of their bodies continue moving while the lower parts are in contact with the bus and stop with it.

                                &quot;When a net force acts upon a body, it produces an acceleration in the body in the direction of the force. The magnitude of the acceleration is directly proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the mass of the body.&quot;

                                If the force &apos;F&apos; is acting on a body of mass &apos;m&apos;, then the relation can be written as <i>F = ma</i>. Here, &apos;a&apos; is the acceleration produced.

                                Newton&apos;s third law of motion deals with the reaction of a body when a force acts on it. If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts an equal and opposite force on body A. The force exerted by body A on B is called the action force, while the force exerted by B on A is called the reaction force. Action and reaction forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction and act on different bodies.

                                Tension is the force transmitted through a string, rope, or cable when it is pulled tight by forces acting from opposite ends. In the case of two bodies connected by a string passing over a pulley, the tension in the string is the same throughout, assuming an ideal pulley with no friction.

                                Friction is the force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of motion between two surfaces in contact. It acts parallel to the surfaces and is responsible for the resistance experienced when moving an object across a surface.

                            <p>
                                Static friction is the frictional force that prevents relative motion between two surfaces that are in contact but not moving. It must be overcome to start the motion of an object. For example, pushing a heavy box that is at rest requires overcoming static friction.
                            </p>
                            <h4 className="font-semibold">2. Kinetic Friction:</h4>
                            <p>
                                Kinetic friction, also known as dynamic friction, is the frictional force acting on surfaces in relative motion. It is generally less than static friction. For instance, once the heavy box starts moving, kinetic friction acts against its motion.

                                Rolling friction occurs when a wheel or ball rolls over a surface. It is usually less than sliding friction. For example, a rolling ball experiences less friction than a sliding block.

                            <h4 className="font-semibold">1. First Law:</h4>
                            <p>
                                The frictional force is directly proportional to the normal force pressing the two surfaces together. This means that as the normal force increases, the frictional force also increases. For example, the friction experienced when pushing a box increases if you press down harder on the box.
                            </p>
                            <h4 className="font-semibold">2. Second Law:</h4>
                            <p>
                                The frictional force is independent of the area of contact between the two surfaces. The frictional force does not significantly change with the area of contact as long as the normal force remains constant. For example, whether you use a large or small shoe sole, the frictional force with the ground remains roughly the same for the same normal force.
                            </p>
                            <h4 className="font-semibold">3. Third Law:</h4>
                            <p>
                                The frictional force is independent of the relative velocity between the two surfaces in contact. The frictional force remains approximately the same regardless of how fast the surfaces are moving relative to each other. For instance, sliding friction is not significantly affected by the speed at which you slide a book across a table.
