        <p className="mb-4">
          When a chemical reaction occurs, old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed. Breaking bonds always requires energy, and forming a bond always releases energy. The amount of energy required to break one mole of a particular bond to form neutral atoms is called the bond dissociation energy. In contrast, the amount of energy released when neutral atoms form one mole of a bond is called bond energy. The difference between the bond dissociation energy and the bond energy determines whether the reaction absorbs or releases energy.

          The enthalpy change in a chemical reaction is the sum of energies absorbed and released in bond breaking and bond forming:
