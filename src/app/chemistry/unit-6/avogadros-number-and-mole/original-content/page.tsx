      <p className="mb-2">
        How do you count your shoes? Since the shoes come in pairs, you&apos;ll probably count them in pairs rather than individually. Likewise, eggs, oranges, etc. are counted in the dozens, but paper with the ream. So the unit of counting depends on what you are counting. Chemists also use a practical unit for counting atoms, molecules and ions. They use a counting unit called mole to measure the amount of a substance.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2">
        A mole is an amount of a substance that contains 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> particles of that substance. This experimentally determined number is known as Avogadro&apos;s number. It is represented by N<sub>A</sub>. Just as a dozen eggs represent twelve eggs, a ream of paper represent 500 papers, a mole of a substance represents 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> representative particles of a substance. For example a mole of carbon is 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> atoms. A mole of sulfur is 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> atoms. A mole of water is 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> molecules.

        Does a dozen eggs have the same mass as a dozen bananas? Does a mole of carbon atoms have a different mass than a mole of sulfur atoms?

      <p className="mb-2">
        The mass of one mole of a substance is called molar mass. What are the molar masses of carbon and sulfur? The term representative particles in a substance are atoms, molecules, formula units or ions. For instance, water exists as molecules, hydrogen exists as H<sub>2</sub> molecules, so one mole of hydrogen contains 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> molecules, carbon exists as atoms so 1 mole of carbon contains 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> atoms.
