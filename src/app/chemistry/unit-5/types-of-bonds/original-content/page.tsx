An ionic bond is a strong electrostatic attraction between positively charged metal ions and negatively charged non-metal ions. Compounds that consist of ions joined by electrostatic forces are called ionic compounds. The total positive charge of the cations must be equal to the total negative charge of the anions because ionic compounds are electrically neutral as a whole.

        <p className="mb-4">Nonmetal atoms tend to share electrons with each other or with other nonmetal atoms, forming a chemical bond called a covalent bond. A chemical bond formed by mutual sharing of electrons between two atoms is called a covalent bond. General representation of a covalent bond is given below.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Consider the formation of a covalent bond between two hydrogen atoms. A hydrogen atom has one valence electron. Two hydrogen atoms share their valence electrons to form a diatomic molecule.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">H + H → H:H (shared pair of electrons)</p>
        <p className="mb-4">In the formation of this molecule, each hydrogen atom reaches the electronic configuration of the noble gas helium with two valence electrons. An electron pair in the region between two atoms attracts both hydrogen nuclei. This creates a strong electrostatic attraction between the shared electrons and the two nuclei. This means that the situation is more stable than in individual atoms. Because of this stability, the two atoms form a covalent bond.
        </p>
        <p className='font-bold'> In a covalent bond, a strong electrostatic forve of attraction between the bonding electrons and two atomic nuclei binds them together.
        </p>
        <p>A covalent bond between two atoms can be represented by using electron-dot and electron-cross symbols for the atoms and the resulting molecule. As already discussed valence electrons are represented by dots. Just to understand sharing, we represent valence electrons in one atom by dots and in the other atom by crosses. However, remember that all the electrons are identical and
cannot be differentiated.
</p><br />
<p>
A shared pair of electrons is also represented by a dash (-) in a molecule.
Consider the formation of a bond between two fluorine atoms. Fluorine belongs to Group VilA, so it has seven electrons in the valence shell. It needs ane more electron to attain the electron configuration of a noble gas. Thus two F-atoms share an electron pair and achieve electron cguration of Ne. For sharing each F-atom contributes one electron to complete the octet.


</p><br />
<p>Pairs of valence electrons that are not shared between atoms are called lone pairs or lone pairs. A covalent bond formed by sharing one pair of electrons is called a single covalent bond. So both H, and F, molecules contain single covalent bond.</p>
<p className='mb-4'>Can you explain the formation of covalent bond between H-atom and a F-atom?
</p>
<p className='mb-4'>Sometimes atoms may share two or three electron pairs to complete an octet. Double covalent bonds are the bonds that are formed by sharing of two electron pairs. <br />Triple covalent bonds are the bonds that involve three shared pairs of electrons.
</p>
<p className='mb-4'>Consider the formation of O, molecules. Oxygen is in Group VI A, so it has 6 electrons in the valence shell. It needs two electrons to complete its octet. So for sharing each O-atom contributes two electrons. <br /><br />
Can you explain the formation of N, molecules?

2. Arrange other atoms around the central atom. Connect the central atom by single bonds.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Non-Polar Covalent Bond:</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">A covalent bond may form between two similar atoms such as in H₂, N₂, O₂, Cl₂, etc. It can also occur between two different atoms, as in HCl, H₂O, NH₃, HCN, CO, etc. When two identical atoms share electron pairs, both atoms exert the same force on the shared electron pairs. Such a covalent bond is called a non-polar covalent bond. For example, bonds H-H, O=O, etc. are non-polar covalent bonds.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Polar Covalent Bond:</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">On the other hand, when two different atoms share an electron pair, both atoms exert different forces on the shared electron pair. The more electronegative atom pulls the shared electron pairs towards itself with a greater force than the other atom. Thus, the more electronegative atom attracts some of the electron density towards itself. This makes it partially negatively charged and the other atoms partially positively charged. Such a covalent bond is called a polar covalent bond. The forces of attraction between molecules are called intermolecular forces. For example, H-C

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5.3.4 Coordinate Covalent Bond</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">A coordinate covalent bond is a type of covalent bond where the shared electron pair comes from a single atom (called donor). Atoms are held together because both nuclei attract a pair of electrons. Once a covalent bond is formed, it is impossible to distinguish the origin of the electrons. Such bonding is usually observed when metal ions bind to ligands. However, nonmetals can also participate in this bond. The reaction between a Lewis acid and a base is a covalent coordinate bond.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Examples of Coordinate Covalent Bonds:</h3>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Ammonium (NH₄⁺) Ion:</strong> The ammonium ion is formed from the reaction of ammonia (NH₃) gas with hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas. In NH₄⁺, the fourth hydrogen is attached by a coordinate covalent bond because only the hydrogen&apos;s nucleus is transferred from the chlorine to the nitrogen. The hydrogen&apos;s electron remains on the chlorine, forming a negative chloride (Cl⁻) ion.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydronium Ion (H₃O⁺):</strong> When hydrogen chloride (HCI) gas dissolves in water to make hydrochloric acid (HCl aq.), a coordinate covalent bond is formed in the hydronium ion. The hydrogen (H) nucleus is transferred to the water (H,O) molecule, which has a lone pair of electrons to form hydronium. So, H does not contribute any electrons to the bond.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ammonia Boron Trifluoride (NH₃-BF₃):</strong> Boron trifluoride (BF,) is a compound that does not have a noble gas structure around the boron(B) atom. The boron only has three pairs of electrons in its valence shell and requires a pair to complete the orbital. Hence, BF, is electron deficient. The lone pair on the nitrogen (N) of the ammonia (NH,) molecule is used to overcome that deficiency, and a complex compound forms through a coordinate covalent bond.
