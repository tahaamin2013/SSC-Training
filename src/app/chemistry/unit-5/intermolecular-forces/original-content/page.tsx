      <p className="mt-4">
        An intermolecular force is the attractive force that exists between molecules.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mt-8">Dipole-Dipole Forces</h4>
      <p className="mt-4">
      Dipole-dipole interactions occur between polar
molecules. Figure 5.1 shows these interactions.

      You know that paints and dyes are used to protect solid surfaces from the atmospheric effects. They also give visual appeal. Resins are used to coat materials that give toughness, flexibility, adhesion and chemical
      resistance. For example dams, bridges, floors, trains, buses, cars etc are painted with resins. The synthetic resins are used where water resistance is required. Chemically, resins are either adhesive or they form bond linkages with the material being bonded together. What is the nature of these linkages?

      </p>
      <p className='mt-2'>Notice that slightly negative end of polar molecule is weakly attracted to the slightly positive end of another molecule. Such attracting forces are called dipole-dipole interactions.

      <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mt-8">Hydrogen Bonding</h4>
      <p className="mt-4">
      Molecules in which hydrogen is covalently bonded to a very electronegative atom such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine is also weakly bonded to a lone pair of electron of another electronegative atom. This other atom may occur in the same molecule or in a nearby molecule. This intermolecular interaction is called hydrogen bonding. Oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine makes hydrogen very electron-deficient. Thus interaction of such a highly electron deficient hydrogen and lone pair on a nearby electronegative atom compensates for the deficiency. Figure 5.2 shows hydrogen bonding in water molecules.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
      The interaction of a highly electron deficient hydrogen and lone pair on a nearby highly electronegative atom such as N, O or F is called hydrogen bond. This phenomenon is called hydrogen bonding.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
      These intermolecular forces are extremely important in determining properties of water, biological molecules, such as proteins, DNA etc and synthetic materials such as glue, paints, resins etc. The adhesive action of paints and dyes is developed due to hydrogen bonding. Synthetic resins bind two surfaces together by hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions

      <p className="mt-4">
      Epoxy adhesives have excellent chemical resistance, good adhesion properties, good heat resistance and they form strong and tough coating. Therefore, propellers and parts of aircraft, boats, cars, trucks etc are held together by epoxy adhesives. Epoxy adhesives contain partially positively charged H-atoms and oxygen atoms containing lone pairs in their molecules. Epoxy adhesives are, therefore, sticky and can make H-bonds with other substances. Modern aircraft, boats and automobiles such as cars, trucks etc and even in space craft epoxy adhesives are used for assembling, saving money and reducing weight. This means glues and adhesives have become an essential item in our daily life.
