            A special type of bonding occurs in metals. In metals, the valence electrons are not confined to individual atoms. These electrons are called free electrons. Metal atoms lose these electrons and form positive ions. The free electrons can move throughout the entire metal structure.

            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
            This leads to the forming a sea of delocalized electrons called the electron sea. The metal cations are held together by the strong electrostatic attractive forces between the metal cations and negatively charged electron sea. This force gives metals their unique properties. This type of bonding is called metallic bonding.

            <p className='mt-2'>The properties of metals that are a consequence of metallic bonding include: <br />
            Malleability <br />
Ductility <br />
High melting and boiling point <br />
High electrical and thermal conductivity Metallic lustre <br />

            1 Metals have giant structures. Metallic bond is strong due to which metals have very high melting and boiling points. This makes them thermally stable.
