      All the matter in this world is composed of almost entirely compounds and their mixtures. Human, animal and plant bodies, rocks, soil, petroleum, coal etc. are all complex mixtures of compounds. In compounds different kinds of atom are bounded together. Few elements also consist of unbounded atoms. For instance, helium, neon, argon, xenon and krypton present in the atmosphere consist of unbounded atoms. The manner in which various atoms are bonded together has a profound effect on the properties of substances.

Some substances are hard and tough, others are soft and flexible why? Resins are widely used to paint dams, bridges, buildings and automobiles. What makes them sticky? How do adhesives such as glue bind two surfaces together? What is the nature of such linkages? The answer lies in the nature of bonding and structure of their molecules. Therefore, to understand the behaviour of various substances, you must understand the nature of chemical bonding and structure of molecules.
