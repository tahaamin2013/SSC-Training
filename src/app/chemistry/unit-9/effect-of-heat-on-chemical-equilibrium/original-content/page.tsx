                <strong>Materials required:</strong> Test tube, dropper, heating system, hydrated copper(ll) sulphate.

            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Place 5 g of hydrated copper (ll) sulphate in a test tube. and heat slowly.</li>
                <li>Observe the colour change from blue to white.</li>
                <li>Allow the test tube and its contents to cool to room temperature.</li>
                <li>Add a few drops of water to the test tube using a dropper.</li>
            </ol>

            <p className="mb-4"><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Observe the colour change from white to blue again. When copper (II) sulphate is heated, the water in it is removed, forming anhydrous copper (II) sulphate, which is a white solid. This copper (II) sulphate changes back to the hydrated form on adding water.

            <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Note:</strong> Copper sulphate is a harmful and toxic compound, so handle it with care. Wear safety glasses and gloves. Do this task in the presence of your teacher.

                Hydrated cobalt(II) chloride is a pink solid. When heated, it loses water and becomes anhydrous cobalt(II) chloride, a blue solid. So the equilibrium shifts towards the right. But when water is added to it, it absorbs water and the equilibrium shifts to the left to form hydrated cobalt (II) chloride again.
