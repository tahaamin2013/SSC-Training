            <p className="mt-4">When making measurements, it is important to be as accurate and precise as possible. Accuracy is a measure of how close an experimental measurement is to the true value. Precision refers to how close repeated measurements (using the same device) are to each other. In general, within the laboratory, accuracy is a measure of how well your equipment is adjusted. For example, if your balance is not adjusted correctly, you can make very precise, repeated measurements, but the measurements will not represent the true value. Precision, on the other hand, is usually determined by how careful the scientist is in making measurements. If you are careless and spill part of your sample on the way, your measurements in repeated experiments will not be precise even if your balance is accurate.</p>
