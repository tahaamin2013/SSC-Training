      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">16.6 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF EXPERIMENTAL METHODS</h1>

      <p>Experimental methods have become a valuable part of human life to learn about the world around them. Chemists used different tools and techniques to perform experimental procedures. Marie Curie, Robert Boyle, Linus Pauling, Ernest Rutherford, and Antoine Lavoisier, for instance, did various experiments to uncover key concepts of chemistry. The same goes for modern experts, who utilize this scientific method to see if new drugs are effective, discover treatments for illnesses, and create new gadgets.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Advantages</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>It gives researchers a high level of control.</li>
        <li>It allows researchers to utilize many variations.</li>
        <li>It can lead to excellent results.</li>
        <li>It can be used in different fields.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Disadvantages</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>It can lead to artificial situations.</li>
        <li>It can take a lot of time and money.</li>
        <li>It can be affected by errors.</li>
        <li>It might not be feasible in some situations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Key Points</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>Physical quantities are measurable quantities.</li>
        <li>Scientific notation is an internationally accepted way of writing numbers in which numbers are recorded using the power of 10, with only one non-zero digit before the decimal.</li>
        <li>Scientific measurements use units to quantify and describe the magnitude of something. For example, scientists quantify length in meters.</li>
        <li>Accuracy represents how close a measurement comes to its true value.</li>
        <li>Precision is how close a series of measurements of the same thing are to each other.</li>
      </ul>
