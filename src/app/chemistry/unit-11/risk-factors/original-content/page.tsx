            <p className="mb-4">
                High-risk life situations that can cause respiratory problems, reduced quality of life, and decreased life expectancy include:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>Long-term exposure to pollutants:</strong> Breathing in polluted air containing nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, ozone, and other harmful pollutants can damage the respiratory system and contribute to diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Smoking:</strong> Tobacco use is a significant risk factor for respiratory diseases. It damages the lungs and airways, increasing the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. Cigarette smoke also harms non-smokers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Indoor pollution:</strong> Poor ventilation, mold, dust, mites, pets, and household chemicals in the home can cause respiratory problems, allergies, and asthma.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Allergens:</strong> Prolonged exposure to allergens such as pollen, mold spores, and pet dander can cause respiratory allergies and asthma.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Climate change:</strong> Climate change impacts air quality, worsening respiratory problems. Increased air pollution, forest fires, rising temperatures, and changes in pollen seasons can exacerbate respiratory symptoms.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mb-4">
                It is important to take protective measures such as reducing exposure to pollutants, quitting smoking, maintaining good indoor air quality, and wearing masks.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">KEY POINTS</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                <li>The envelope of gases and water vapor surrounding the planet Earth is called the atmosphere.</li>
                <li>Anything that is in the air, water, or soil which has a harmful effect on the environment is called a pollutant.</li>
                <li>Some air pollution occurs naturally, but many types are the result of human activities.</li>
                <li>Methane is produced when dead plant material decays in the absence of air.</li>
                <li>Air that contains harmful particles and gases is said to be polluted.</li>
                <li>The warming of the atmosphere due to our influence on the greenhouse effect is known as global warming.</li>
                <li>Acid rain is defined as rain having a pH less than 5.6.</li>
                <li>Ozone is an allotropic form of oxygen comprising three oxygen atoms.</li>
            </ul>
