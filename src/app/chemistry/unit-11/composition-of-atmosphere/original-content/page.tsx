                Explain how the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane cause global warming, some example include:
                (a) the absorption, reflection, and emission of thermal energy. (b) reducing thermal energy loss to space.
                Describe the role of sulphur in the formation of acid rain and its impact on the environment.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Describe the strategies to reduce the effect of environmental issues. Some examples include
                (a) climate change: planting trees, reduction in livestock farming, decreasing use of fossil fuels, increasing use if hydrogen,
                and renewable energy, e.g., wind, solar (b) acid rain: use of catalytic converters in vehicles, reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide
                by using low sulphur fuels and flue gas desulphurization with calcium oxide.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Describe the role of NO and NO<sub>x</sub> in the formation of acid rain, both directly and through their catalytic role
                in the oxidation of atmospheric sulphur dioxide. Explain how oxides of nitrogen form in car engines and describe their
                removal by catalytic converters, e.g. CO-2NO â†’ 2CO+N.

            <p className="mb-4">
                This chapter will help you understand what atmosphere means. How the atmosphere is polluted and what substances pollute it?
                It is also necessary to understand the sources of general air pollution and the harmful effects on living things and the environment.
                You start your day with a cup of tea, which is a mixture of water, milk, tea, fat, and sugar. The same applies to milk,
                which is a mixture of water, minerals, proteins, vitamins, and fats. If scum or impure ingredients are added, the tea or milk
                is contaminated and unhealthy to drink. Air is a mixture of various gases including nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide,
                noble gases, and water vapor. The summer season is getting longer and hotter all over the world compared to ten years ago, why?
                You also know why iron nails rust faster in rainwater than in tap water or mineral water.

                Air is a mixture of gases. Can you name the main gases that make up the air?
                The pie chart given below shows the composition of dry air by volume. (Figure 11.1)

                Besides gases, there are varying amounts of water vapour in the air. There is little water in the air ver the desert
                amounts in the tropical rainforest, the air may contain little water in the air This means the amount of water vapour
                in the air varies from place to place and from tapeur time The envelope of gases and water vapour surrounding the planet
                Earth is called the atmosphere.
