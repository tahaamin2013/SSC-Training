                The study of carbon-containing compounds and their properties is called organic chemistry. However, low carbon compounds such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbonates and carbides are considered Inorganic substances. This is because they have completely different properties than organic compounds. Organic compounds play an important role in the body of living beings. Industrial organic chemical products such as plastics, rubber, synthetic fibers, paints, glues, varnishes, artificial sweeteners and flavors, drugs, dyes, soaps and detergents, etc. is an important part of modern life. Furthermore, the energy we mostly depend on is based mainly on organic materials found in coal, oil and natural gas.

                The Chemistry of carbon compounds pervades every aspect of our lives. We use thousands of carbon compounds every day. They are carrying out important chemical reactions within our bodies. Many of them are so vital that we cannot live without them. A detailed study of organic compounds confirms that carbon is their essential constituent in combination with H, O, N, S, P and halogens. They may also (rarely) contain metal atoms. Organic compounds are also defined as the hydrocarbons and their derivatives.
