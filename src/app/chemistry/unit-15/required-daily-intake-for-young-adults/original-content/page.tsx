                Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body is deprived of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Malnutrition occurs in people who are either undernourished or overnourished.

            <p className="mb-4">
                Marasmus is a disease caused by insufficient levels of nutrition in the diet. Marasmus is severely undernutrition, a deficiency in all the macronutrients that the body requires to function, including carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

                Research proves that food consisting of mostly high-calorie-density foods has a high risk of weight gain and obesity. Calorie density also affects hunger. Low-calorie-density foods tend to provide less fat and more water and fiber. Look at the density chart and examine:
