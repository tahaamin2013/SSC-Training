      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Think about your brain. It works 24/7, even while you are asleep. Your brain supervises all your body functions, your thoughts, your breath, your heartbeat, even your senses. In this scenario, your brain requires a constant supply of fuel. Food is a fuel that drives the processes of life. That &quot;fuel&quot; comes from the foods you eat, and what&apos;s in that fuel makes all the difference. If your brain couldn&apos;t get good-quality nutrition, it can affect the functioning of the brain. It means what you eat directly affects the structure and function of your brain and, finally, your life.

      <p className="mb-4">
        Nutrition is the source of food required by living things to stay alive. Our food choices impact our health. Good nutrition forms an important part of a healthy lifestyle. All living organisms are made up of molecules that carry out characteristics of life. The total number of molecules or nutrients that we need is called nutrition or diet.

      <p className="mb-4">
        A &quot;balanced diet&quot; provides all the nutrients in suitable amounts needed to carry out the processes. At every life stage, our diet is fundamental to our overall health and happiness. A healthy diet can lower the risk of disease. It also increases bone health and muscle strength.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A balanced diet includes a variety of foods in limited amounts and proportions to satisfy the needs for calories, proteins, minerals, vitamins, and other nutrients. A balanced diet should contain the correct proportion of six basic nutrients, e.g., carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber.
