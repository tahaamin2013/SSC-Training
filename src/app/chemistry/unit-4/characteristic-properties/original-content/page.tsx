                  Metallic nature refers to a property of elements in the periodic table that 
                  determines how easily they can lose electrons and form positive ions (cations). 
                  Elements with metallic character have a strong tendency to lose electrons and 
                  easily form cations. The metallic character of an element is affected by its 
                  position in the periodic table.

                  <p className="text-lg">
                    Metallic character increases as you move down a group in the periodic table. 
                    This is primarily due to addition of new electronic shells. The outermost 
                    electrons are farther from the nucleus and experiences weaker attractive 
                    forces, making it easier for them to be lost. This promotes metallic character.

                    Metallic character decreases as you move across a period from left to right 
                    in the periodic table. This is because effective nuclear charge increases 
                    across a period, while the number of shells remains the same. The stronger 
                    attractive forces make it more difficult for valence electrons to be lost.

                <p className="text-lg">
                  The capability of an element to react with other elements to form new compounds is called it reactivity. Reactivity of elements generally increases as you move down a group. This is due to the increase in atomic size. The outermost electrons are farther from the nucleus and experience weaker attractive forces, making it easier for them to participate in chemical reaction.

                <p className="text-lg mt-4">
                  Reactivity tends to very across a period. Elements on the left side of a period (Group 1 and 2) are highly reactive due to their strong tendency to lose electrons and form positive ions. Elements on the right side of a period (Group 16 and 17) are highly reactive as well but tend to gain electrons to form negative ions.
