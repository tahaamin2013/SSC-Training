      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">7.4 OXIDIZING AND REDUCING AGENTS</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        An oxidizing agent is a substance that causes another substance to oxidize by taking electrons from it. It is often called an electron acceptor because it accepts electrons during a reaction.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Oxidizing agents themselves are reduced in the process (they gain electrons). Examples of common oxidizing agents are oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>), and potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>). A reducing agent is a substance that causes another substance to be reduced by donating electrons to it. It is often called an electron donor because it loses electrons during the reaction. The reducing agents themselves are oxidized in the process (they lose electrons). Examples of common reducing agents include hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>), metal hydrides (such as NaBH<sub>4</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and metals such as zinc (Zn) and aluminum (Al).
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For example, in the reaction between sodium and chlorine to form sodium chloride:
        <br />
        2Na + Cl<sub>2</sub> → 2NaCl
        <br />
        Na is the reducing agent as it is oxidized, whereas Cl<sub>2</sub> is the oxidizing agent as it is reduced.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Activity 7.1</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Prepare solutions of ferrous sulphate (FeSO<sub>4</sub>) and potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) in separate beakers. Transfer about 10 cm<sup>3</sup> of ferrous sulphate solution into a test tube. Add about 10 cm<sup>3</sup> of dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to it. Now add a few drops of KMnO<sub>4</sub> solution to the test tube. What happens?
        <br />
        FeSO<sub>4</sub> reduces KMnO<sub>4</sub>, so its purple color is discharged. KMnO<sub>4</sub> oxidizes FeSO<sub>4</sub> in this reaction. FeSO<sub>4</sub> is the reducing agent, whereas KMnO<sub>4</sub> is the oxidizing agent.
      </p>

        A color change during a chemical reaction may indicate a redox reaction.
        <br />
        Potassium permanganate (VII) is an oxidizing agent.
        <br />
        Often used to test for the presence of reducing agents.
        <br />
        When acidified KMnO<sub>4</sub> is added to the reducing agent, it changes from purple to colorless.
        <br />
        The above reaction discharges the purple color of KMnO<sub>4</sub>.
        <br />
        Therefore, the solution must contain a reducing agent that reduces MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> ions (purple) to Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions (colorless).
        <br />
        During this reaction, the oxidation number of Mn changes from +7 to +2.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Activity 7.2</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Prepare an aqueous solution of potassium iodide and transfer it to a 10 cm<sup>3</sup> test tube. Add about 5 cm<sup>3</sup> of hydrogen peroxide to it. What&apos;s going on? The solution turns reddish-brown, indicating the formation of iodine.
        <br />
        Potassium iodide is a reducing agent. Often used to test for the presence of oxidizing agents. When a potassium iodide solution is added to an acidified hydrogen peroxide solution, the solution turns reddish-brown. The appearance of this color is due to the formation of iodine (I<sub>2</sub>).
        <br />
        KI is oxidized, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is reduced.
        <br />
        This redox reaction can be confirmed by a color change from colorless to reddish-brown.
        <br />
        2KI + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + I<sub>2</sub>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">7.4.2 How can you identify oxidizing and reducing agents in a chemical reaction?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Consider the following reaction that takes place in the manufacture of steel:
        <br />
        Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO<sub>2</sub>
        <br />
        To identify the oxidizing and reducing agents, work out the oxidation states of all the elements involved in the reaction.
        <br />
        Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>: Fe = +3, O = -2
        <br />
        CO: C = +2, O = -2
        <br />
        Fe: 0
        <br />
        CO<sub>2</sub>: C = +4, O = -2
        <br />
        (i) Carbon is being oxidized because there is an increase in its oxidation state.
        <br />
        (ii) Fe is being reduced because there is a decrease in its oxidation state.
        <br />
        (iii) The reactant CO contains the C that is being oxidized, so CO is the reducing agent.
        <br />
        (iv) The reactant Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> contains the Fe that is being reduced. So Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is the oxidizing agent.
        <br />
        Oxidizing or reducing agent is the whole molecule or formula unit and not the atom that has undergone a change in oxidation number.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Example 7.6: Identifying the oxidizing and reducing agents</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Tungsten is used to make filaments for electric bulbs because it has the highest melting point and high electrical resistance. This metal is obtained from tungsten (VI) oxide, WO<sub>3</sub>, by reducing it with hydrogen gas.
        <br />
        WO<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub> → W + 3H<sub>2</sub>O
        <br />
        Identify the oxidizing and reducing agents in this reaction.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Problem-solving strategy:</strong>
        <br />
        Step 1: Work out the oxidation states of all the elements involved in the reaction.
        <br />
        Step 2: Note the element that is undergoing an increase in its oxidation state. Since it is being oxidized, the reactant that contains this element is the reducing agent.
        <br />
        Step 3: Note the element that is undergoing a decrease in its oxidation state. Since it is being reduced, the reactant that contains this element is the oxidizing agent.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
        <br />
        First, assign oxidation numbers to each atom.
        <br />
        WO<sub>3</sub>: W = +6, O = -2
        <br />
        H<sub>2</sub>: H = 0
        <br />
        W: 0
        <br />
        H<sub>2</sub>O: H = +1, O = -2
        <br />
        Because the oxidation number of W decreases, WO<sub>3</sub> is an oxidizing agent. Similarly, the oxidation number of H increases, therefore H<sub>2</sub> is the reducing agent.

        Silver is a very soft metal. Silver atoms have weak interactions and are loosely packed together. Silver tarnishes in air when it comes in contact with trace quantities of H<sub>2</sub>S or SO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere or food such as eggs, which are rich in sulfur compounds. Silver tarnish is silver sulfide that gives silver a blackish appearance. Due to this reason, decorative and practical objects made of solid silver gradually turn black and lose their shining appearance. Decorative and practical objects are plated with a thin layer of silver. Atoms in thin layers firmly adhere to the metal atoms of the object and form a durable layer. An article thickly plated with silver contains many layers of silver atoms. Such layers form a soft covering. These layers gradually turn black.
