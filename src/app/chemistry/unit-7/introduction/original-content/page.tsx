      Oxidation-reduction reactions (redox) are fundamental chemical processes that play a crucial role in a variety of natural phenomena and industrial applications. This chapter examines the ammalities beties, forest fires, and the metabolism of food in human and animal bodies in addition, the importance redox reactions in the production of electricity in batteries in the decolorization of substances with household bleaches, and in the industrial production of important metals and chemical is discussed.
