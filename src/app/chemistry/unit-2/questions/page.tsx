1. Why does pouring juice from a carton seems effortless compared to pushing a block of cheese across the table? <br /> 
2. Why do these liquids flow differently? <br /> 
3. What makes exotic states different from fundamentals states of matter? <br /> 
4. The display on your phone or laptop utilizes a special type of matter called a &quot;liquid crystal&quot;. How does this state differ from a typical liquid, and what unique properties does it possess? <br /> 
5. Where might you encounter plasma outside of a laboratory, and what are some key features that distinguish it from the other states? <br /> 
6. How is a mixture of Sulphur and iron (in powder form) different from their compound-iron sulphide (it is formed by heating iron and Sulphur together)? <br />
