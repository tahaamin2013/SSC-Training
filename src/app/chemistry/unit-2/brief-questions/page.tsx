  {
    id: 13,
    question: "What do you mean by Pascal? How many Pascals are equal to 1 atm?",
    answer: "Pascal is the SI unit of pressure. One Pascal (Pa) = 1 Nm². 1 atm = 101325 Pa."
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    question: "Does the density of a gas decrease on cooling?",
    answer: "The density of gases increases by cooling because their volume decreases. For example, at normal atmospheric pressure, the density of oxygen gas is 1.4 g/dm³ at 20°C and 1.5 g/dm³ at 0°C."
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    question: "Why is the density of gas measured in g/dm³, while that of a liquid is expressed in g/cm³?",
    answer: "Gases have low densities due to light mass and more volume occupied by the gas molecules. That is why gas density is expressed in grams per dm³, whereas liquid and solid densities are expressed in grams per cm³ because liquids and solids are 1000 times denser than gases."
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    question: "Convert the following: a) 70 cm of Hg to atm",
    answer: "We know that 760 cm Hg = 1 atm. Therefore, 70 cm Hg = 70 / 760 = 0.092 atm."
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    question: "Convert the following: b) 3.5 atm to torr",
    answer: "1 atm = 760 torr. Therefore, 3.5 atm = 3.5 × 760 = 2660 torr."
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    question: "Convert the following: c) 1.5 atm to Pa",
    answer: "1 atm = 101325 Pa. Therefore, 1.5 atm = 1.5 × 101325 = 151987.5 Pa."

  {
    id: 27,
    question: "Which parameters are kept constant in Charles's Law?",
    answer: "In Charles's Law, pressure remains constant."
  },
  {
    id: 28,
    question: "Why does the volume of gas decrease with an increase in pressure?",
    answer: "The volume of gas decreases with an increase in pressure because pressure and volume are inversely proportional to each other. When pressure increases, volume decreases, and vice versa."
  },
  {
    id: 29,
    question: "Does the Kelvin scale show a negative temperature?",
    answer: "No, the Kelvin scale does not show negative values. 0 K is equivalent to -273°C."
  },
  {
    id: 30,
    question: "When a gas is allowed to expand, what will be its effect on its temperature?",
    answer: "When a gas expands, its temperature will increase because volume and temperature are directly proportional to each other."
  },
  {
    id: 31,
    question: "Can you cool a gas by increasing its volume?",
    answer: "Yes, by suddenly increasing the volume of a gas, it results in a cooling effect."
  },
  {
    id: 32,
    question: "In which units is body temperature measured?",
    answer: "Body temperature is measured in Fahrenheit. Normal body temperature is 98.6°F, which is equivalent to 37°C."
  },
  {
    id: 33,
    question: "What is meant by liquid?",
    answer: "Matter that has an indefinite shape but a definite volume is called a liquid. Examples include water, milk, etc."
  },
  {
    id: 34,
    question: "Define evaporation. On which factors does it depend?",
    answer: "Evaporation is the process of molecules escaping spontaneously from the surface of a liquid. It depends on the following factors: (i) Temperature, (ii) Surface area, (iii) Wind speed, (iv) Humidity."
  },
  {
    id: 35,
    question: "Why does a liquid have a definite volume?",
    answer: "A liquid has a definite volume because the intermolecular forces are strong enough to keep the liquid molecules together, unlike gases."
  },
  {
    id: 36,
    question: "How can you measure the density of a liquid?",
    answer: "Density of a liquid can be measured using a hydrometer or by calculating mass per unit volume using a balance and graduated cylinder."
  },
  {
    id: 37,
    question: "How do you convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius?",
    answer: "To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, use the formula: (°F - 32) × 5/9 = °C. For example, to convert 98.6°F to Celsius: (98.6 - 32) × 5/9 = 37°C."
  },
  {
    id: 38,
    question: "Why does ice float on water?",
    answer: "Ice floats on water because it is less dense than liquid water. When water freezes, it expands and becomes less dense."
  },
  {
    id: 39,
    question: "What happens to the density of a gas if its temperature is increased?",
    answer: "When the temperature of a gas is increased, its volume expands, which decreases its density because density is the mass divided by volume."
  },
  {
    id: 40,
    question: "Define the term 'pressure' in terms of force and area.",
    answer: "Pressure is the force exerted per unit area. It can be calculated using the formula: Pressure = Force / Area."
