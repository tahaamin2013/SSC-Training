            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Colloid</h3>
            <p>
                These are heterogeneous mixtures in which the solute particles are larger than those present in true solutions but not large enough to be seen by the naked eye. A colloid is a mixture with particles ranging in diameter, yet are still able to remain dispersed without settling at the bottom of the container. These are also known as colloidal dispersions because the substances remain dispersed and do not settle. The particles are large enough to scatter a beam of light, which is known as the Tyndall effect. The Tyndall effect is the main characteristic that distinguishes colloids from solutions, making them false solutions or colloidal solutions. Examples include starch, albumin, soap solutions, blood, milk, ink, jelly, and toothpaste.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Suspension</h3>
            <p>
                A suspension is defined as a heterogeneous mixture in which solid particles are spread throughout the liquid without dissolving. It is a mixture of undissolved particles in a given medium. The particles are large enough (greater than 1000 nm) to be seen with the naked eye. Examples include chalk in water (milky suspension), paints, and milk of magnesia (suspension of magnesium oxide in water).
