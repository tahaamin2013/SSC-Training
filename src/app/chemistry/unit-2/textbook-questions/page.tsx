          <li className="text-gray-800">Q2: Describe the three main states of matter (solid, liquid and gas) and their distinguishing macroscopic properties: density, compressibility, and fluidity.</li>
          <li className="text-gray-800">Q3: Write a detailed note on Plasma, Bose-Einstein Condensate 
            <br />(Cantab Exercise Question) OR Discuss exotic states of matter in detail. OR Recognize other forms of matter beyond the three basic states (e.g plasma, bose-cinstein condensates, liquid crystals). Relevant SLO in curriculum)
            <br />A Sketch diagrams to show the arrangement of particles in:
            <br />(i) Solid Oxygen
            <br />(ii) liquid oxygen
            <br />(iii) oxygen gas
            <br />Describe how the particles move in these three states of matter.
            <br />Following substances that have been used to create Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)

            <br />Helium atoms etc.
            <br />What are the three common states of matter that we encounter in our everyday lives?
            <br />Discuss the conditions required for the formation of a Bose-Einstein Condensate, and what unique properties does it exhibit at such extreme temperatures?
            <br />How liquid crystals exhibit properties of both liquids and solids?</li>

          <li className="text-gray-800">Q5: Define the term Allotropes. Explain the allotropes of carbon. NBF Exercise Question). OR Explain allotropes and their significance (Cantab Exercise Question).
            <br />1. What are allotropic forms of solids, and why do they have distinct properties.
            <br />2. Provide examples of allotropic forms of carbon and briefly describe their structural differences.
            <br />3. How does the atomic arrangement in diamond differ from that in graphite, and how do these differences affect their properties?

            <br />1. What are elements, and how are they different from compounds and mixtures?
            <br />2. Give an example of an element, a compound, and a mixture from everyday life.
            <br />3. Write down the difference between a solution, a colloid, and a suspension, including the particle sizes and properties of each.
            <br />4. Provide real life examples of a suspension and explain why its particles settle over time.
            <br />5. Describe the factors that influence the solubility of a substance, with a specific focus on the effect of temperature.
