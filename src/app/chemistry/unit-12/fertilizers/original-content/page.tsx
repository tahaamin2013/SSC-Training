      <p className="mb-4">Fertilizers are substances that provide essential elements for plant growth. These elements are essential to enhance crop yields. Fertilizers mainly provide three main nutrients, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), hence known as NPK fertilizers. Urea, potassium nitrate, and ammonium salts such as di-ammonium phosphate (superphosphate) are important fertilizers. Fertilizers dissolve in water. So they provide nutrients to the plants in a readily available form. It is important to give fertilizers at the right time and in the right amount. This practice is called nutrient management. It optimizes the intake of nutrients by plants and reduces the loss of nutrients. This practice can minimize environmental problems such as nutrient runoff into water bodies.</p>
