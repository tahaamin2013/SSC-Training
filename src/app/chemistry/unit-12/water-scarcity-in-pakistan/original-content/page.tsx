      <p className="mb-4">Water scarcity is a major problem in Pakistan. This is mainly due to the following factors.</p>

      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 mb-6">
        <li>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Population Growth:</h2>
          <p>The population of Pakistan is growing rapidly, which increases the demand for water in agriculture, industry, and homes.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Climate change:</h2>
          <p>Climate change has caused irregular rainfall patterns, which affects water availability Climate Chy&apos;s water resources are also declining due to excessive extraction of water from groundwater aquifers and insufficient irrigation practices.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Inadequate water supply:</h2>
          <p>Traditional flood irrigation methods are widely used in Pakistan. This has resulted in significant water losses through evaporation and inadequate water distribution.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p className="mb-4">To solve the problem of water scarcity in Pakistan, the following are necessary:</p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Effective water management practices.</li>
        <li>Development of infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Policy reforms.</li>
        <li>Public awareness of responsible water use and its promotion.</li>
        <li>Strict regulations and monitoring systems to control groundwater and prevent illegal drilling are essential.</li>
