                <p>Where does the water in your kitchen and bathroom come from? Because water comes from different sources, its quality varies. Do you drink water that has a colour, a bad taste or an unpleasant smell? When you wake up in the morning, what do you do? You brush your teeth, take a shower, flush the toilet, etc. What happens to the water flowing out of the drain? Can you reuse this water? Sewage is often poured into open gutters and allowed to flow directly into streams, rivers and oceans. This practice spreads diseases and also threatens aquatic life. How? This will become clear in this chapter. The presence of disease-causing bacteria affects water quality. Water from both public and private sources often requires treatment to ensure it is clean and safe to drink. Wastewater should also undergo treatment to remove unwanted substances before entering lakes, rivers or oceans. Otherwise, it would also affect marine life and, through the food chain, humans.</p>

                <p>Water is the only substance that exists in three different states on Earth. Can you name these states?</p>
                <p>Pure water is transparent, colourless, odourless and tasteless. It boils at 100°Cand freezes at O&quot;C at the sea level.</p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Detection of water with anhydrous (II) copper sulphate</h3>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
                <p>The objective of this activity is to demonstrate the ability of anhydrous copper(II) sulphate to detect the presence of water by observing its reaction and colour change.</p>
                <p><strong>Materials Required:</strong></p>
                <p>Anhydrous copper (II) sulphate (in powder form), a dry test tube or small beaker, a pipette or pipette, spatula.</p>
                <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
                <ol className="list-decimal pl-6">
                    <li>Take a small amount of anhydrous copper (II) sulphate powder with spatula and place it in a dry test tube or beaker.</li>
                    <li>Observe the initial state and the appearance of anhydrous copper(II) sulphate powder before adding water. It should be a white or off-white crystalline.</li>
                    <li>Carefully add a few drops of water to the anhydrous copper(II) sulphate powder in the container using a dropper or pipette.</li>
                    <li>Observe the reaction. When water comes into contact with anhydrous copper(II) sulphate, a chemical reaction occurs in it. Copper(II) sulphate reacts with water to form hydrated copper(II) sulphate, which is blue in colour.</li>
                    <li>Observe and note the colour change that occurs. A white anhydrous copper (II) sulphate powder should turn light blue when reacted with water. This colour change confirms the presence of water.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Interpretation of results:</strong></p>
                <p>Anhydrous copper(II) sulphate is a white crystalline solid. It does not contain water molecules. However, it has ability to absorb water from the surrounding environment through a process called hydration. When water is added to anhydrous copper(II) sulphate, it undergoes chemical reaction. It reacts with water forming hydrated copper (II) sulphate, which has a distinct blue colour. The appearance of blue colour indicates the presence of water in it.</p>
                <p><strong>Safety Precautions:</strong></p>
                <p>Copper sulphate is a toxic compound, so handle it carefully. Perform this activity under the adult supervision. Wear gloves and safety goggles, and wash your hands, when the activity is over.</p>

                <p>Water is very good at dissolving substances. For this reason natural water such as rainwater and groundwater is not pure water. As water falls through the atmosphere, it dissolves, a little oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and dust particies. During thunder storms, it also dissolves nitric acid. Ground water dissolves minerals from rocks and soils as it moves along on or beneath Earth&apos;s surface. Ground water also dissolves many substances from decaying plants and animals.</p>

High concentrations of phosphate can cause eutrophication. This can cause harmful algae blooms and oxygen caps in water bodies. Detergents used in water systems can destroy the outer mucous membranes that protect fish from bacteria and parasites. In addition, detergents can also damage their gills.</li>
