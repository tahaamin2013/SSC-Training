              It is true that for practical purposes, human life can be divided into various fields. However, treating each field as an independent and isolated island is extremely harmful. The individual and collective, political and economic, social and cultural aspects of life are so interconnected that they cannot be entirely separated into distinct parts. In human life, it is impossible to create a complete distinction between these different fields.

              Just as it is impossible for half of your face to smile while the other half does not, it is also impossible for life to flourish solely by organizing the economy while ignoring politics. Similarly, just as a person cannot walk in different directions at the same time or ride two boats going in opposite directions, it is also impossible for the various aspects of human life to work towards entirely different goals simultaneously.

              Experience has taught modern humans that if they seek stability in their personality and genuine progress in civilization, they must choose the path of unity and cohesion over fragmentation. This is why the greatest need of the present time is for a healthy philosophy of life that can rescue the world from the chaos it finds itself inâ€”a chaos that is proving to be fatal for humanity.
